# The 3rdHandData repository of the MLR group

This repository contains the motion data captured by the MLR setup. 

Although the setup records multiple modalities of data (including videos and
depth images), this repository only contains the motion captured by the
Polhemus G4 hardware.

## Installation

No installation is required.
Installation may be required for programs which make use of this data.

## Documentation

### Models

The models/ folder contains object models and meshes.  Most files here are
written in our ORS (Open Robot Simulator) format.  Eventually these will be
converted to a more standard format, but for the time being you shouldn't care
too much about these files;  they don't contain motion data, and will be used
automatically by other programs, e.g. the visualization tools which we also
provide.

### Data

The data/ folder contains the motion data. Each subfolder of data/ refers to
one specific demonstration and will contain the following files:

 * poses.dat and poses.dat.times contain the actual data and the respective
   timestamps. Poses.dat is structured as a sequence of matrices surrounded by
   squared brackets.  Each matrix indicates a frame of data and contains as
   many rows as sensors and 7 columns. The columns represent (in order) the x,
   y and z coordinates of the sensor (in meters), and the w, x, y and z
   parameters of the quaternion describing the sensor's orientation.  A row of
   all 0's indicates missing data (either that sensor doesn't exist in this
   demonstration, or that specific frame for that sensor was not registered).
   The association between rows and sensors is described in meta.kvg.  Each row
   in timestamp in poses.dat.times indicates the timestamp of one of the data
   frames contained in poses.dat.

 * meta.kvg contains metadata about the environment, such as associations
   between sensors and objects/agents in the environment, and the hierarchical
   structure of agents and objects.  The row in the data matrix relative to
   each sensor is written as the corresponding property 'rn').

 * world.ors contains the environment model in the ORS format, and includes the
   objects models relevant for this demonstration.

Optionally, each recording might also have the following files:

 * elan* and ann* are annotation files which contain ground truth and labels
   for our learning algorithms.  Not all demonstrations are annotated.

 * data.json is a more standard and unified format for the data which replaces
   all of the above; it is still under development and shouldn't be used at the
   current state.

If you intend to use this data in your program, you will most likely only be
interested in poses.dat, poses.dat.times and meta.kvg (you'll want to extract
the row number from meta.kvg manually and use it in your program). In future
releases of this repository, data.json will contain all the respective
information.
